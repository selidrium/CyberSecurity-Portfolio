- Service enumeration (nmap, netcat, etc.)
- Analysis of open ports and running services
- Any initial clues or data found during this phase

## Exploitation

-The SMB (Samba) exploit:

I quickly found that the service running under port 139 (samba) was seriously vulnerable and decided to attack that. (Note: Samba is very similar to FTP / NFS, itâ€™s basically a file-sharing system between Linux and Windows).

Searched for Samba 2.2.1a exploit on metasploit:

Explain how you approached exploiting the challenge:
- Vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified
- Tools used (exploit frameworks, custom scripts, etc.)
- Step-by-step breakdown of the exploitation process
- Screenshots, code snippets, or command outputs to illustrate each step

## Privilege Escalation
If applicable, describe how you escalated privileges:
- Any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities identified
- Exploits or techniques used for privilege escalation
- Detailed explanation of how you gained higher-level access

## Flag Retrieval
Detail how you located and captured the flag(s):
- Method used to identify the flag location
- Exact flag(s) content and format
- Proof of flag retrieval (screenshot or flag content)

## Conclusion
Summarize your experience and takeaways from the challenge:
- Lessons learned during the CTF
- New skills or knowledge gained
- Challenges faced and how you overcame them
- Shoutouts or acknowledgments to teammates or resources

## Resources
List any external sources, tools, or references you used:
- Official documentation
- Write-ups from other participants (if referred)
- Tools or frameworks used
