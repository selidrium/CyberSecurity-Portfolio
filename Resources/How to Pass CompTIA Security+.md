## Introduction

Welcome to my personal CompTIA Security+ success story! I'm excited to share my journey and the strategies that helped me not only pass but excel in the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a beginner, or someone aiming to boost your career, I hope my experience can provide valuable insights and guidance on your path to success.

## Background

I don't have the A+ or the Net+, though I do have a Bachelor's in IT. After completing the Sec+, I do believe getting the Net+ or the CCNA would be beneficial for understanding foundational concepts, I think my experience in the Ethical Hacking courses helped me fill my Network gaps otherwise I probably would have benefitted from getting the Net+ first.

## Why CompTIA Security+?

Before diving into my journey, let's briefly discuss why CompTIA Security+ is a pivotal certification for anyone aspiring to excel in the field of cybersecurity. CompTIA Security+ is renowned for its industry recognition, covering essential cybersecurity topics, and serving as a stepping stone for various cybersecurity career paths.

- Dion's training was the first course I started, but I found it lacked a lot of the exam objectives, so I would leave it for last, as a source of supplemental knowledge

## Videos

 Whenever I had trouble understanding some Networking objectives, I found watching visual lessons helpful

## Interactive Labs
 Whenever I felt burnt out, I would practice some ethical hacking and it helped me learn more about the tools covered in the exam objectives.

## Additional Tips 

- **Exam Tips**:

  - SKIP THE PBQs!! Go back to them once you finish all the multiple-choice questions

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them

- The hardest domains are by far:
  - Domain 2
  - Domain 3
- I spent the most time reviewing those domains, rewatching all of Professor Messer's videos that cover those specific domains, as well as the Security+ Cram videos for the specific domains.
- Keep track of your progress, I would make a Word document for each Professe Messer Exam, set it up into 3 columns, and every page covered a new attempt. Every page showed improvement, which boosts confidence, a good marker to let you know you are ready.

- Professor Messer does a great job of letting you know what objective and domain you missed and provides a link to the video covering that objective on the exam answers.
- I used Excel to create a spreadsheet that tracked which areas I was lacking in the most, and what videos I needed to watch, once I watched the video or the domain, I highlighted them in green to let me know I watched them already, and once I covered all of my missed objectives, I tried the exam again. Each time I noticed the list was getting smaller and smaller.

## Results and What's Next

- After 6 weeks of studying, I decided to bite the bullet and take the exam, I passed with an 805.
  
## Final Thoughts

- You will never feel completely prepared for the exam, but you will reach a point where you don't think you can do anything else to cover more since you have exhausted all your resources, and taken the exams too many times, I believe this is when you know you are ready for the exam.
- Take a leap of faith!
