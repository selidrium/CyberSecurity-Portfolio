# Audit Checklist

Before conducting an audit, it's essential to create an audit checklist. This checklist typically comprises the following areas of focus:

## Identify the Scope of the Audit

The audit should:

- List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.)
- Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
- Indicate how often an audit should be performed
- Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to ensure they are functioning as intended and being implemented by employees

## Complete a Risk Assessment

A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

## Conduct the Audit

When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

## Create a Mitigation Plan

A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization's security posture.

## Communicate Results to Stakeholders

The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
